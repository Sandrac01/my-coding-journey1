<h2 class="coding mt-3">Why Coding!</h2>
<p>I decided to take  up on codig because learning to code is no longer a “speciality” skill. Rather, it has become a mainstream, core discipline utilized in nearly every industry; requiring more and more skilled workers every year.Coding tests a variety of abilities. It hones problem-solving and analysis skills, such as finding errors and thinking logically. Further, coding often helps people develop teamwork and interpersonal skills since software and application projects are often cross-disciplinary and collaborative. Coding is a skill that translates into many career paths and enhances many others; making professionals more versatile and valuable to employers.</p>
<div class="advantages">
    <ul>
        <li>Learning to code gives access to various career opportunities.Job prospects for coders extend far beyond technology companies. With coding knowledge and skills l am able to gain access to careers in healthcare, education, public sector (governmanet and social service) as well as private sector.</li>
        <li>Projections for coding careers remain strong and web development is one of the on careers on demand. As the demand for web-developers keep growing, I am workig towards expandig my career in the field of technology. </li>
        <li>Numerous programming languages to choose from and build a cereer. Whilst focusing on building websites l work with many programming languages and the main ones are HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Node js.</li>
        <li>Coding also improves your critical thinking and creativity skills. As noted by Steve Jobs, coding teaches the mind to view problems from multiple perspectives and think creatively about solving them.</li>

<h2>Whats next for me</h2>
<p>The most exciting thing about coding is its fun, you get to build websites that you want and keep learning as your go and advance your skills. There is no dull moment in coding and my next step is to dive into the working pool and showcase my skills. I plan on advancing my coding skills everytime l build a website and keep taking more courses. I am interested in AI training as well, it is another  interesting course l have started and my goal is to ad this experience to my portfolio and build my Tech cereer without any limitations. </p>
